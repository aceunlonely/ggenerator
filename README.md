# ggenerator

## i wanna tell you that
1. what is gg(ggenerator)
    it is designed as a code generator to generate code by one data and a template,
    generating file content is easy using template engine like juicer .....
    but files are different, then i designed a structure named fom (file object model)
    to generate diff files, we can define diffenret fom ,like @ demo.fom
    after all,all tgt files can be generated by just data and template

2. then i think of
    more useful
    easier to use
    store our template in one center
    easier to generator ddata

after all,ggenerator is an engine to run your mind, to complete your task
    you shall change your mind that how to use software to complete your task,
        you shall use template idea ,never a whole sealed system
